# README# KWBOOKING
KWBOOKING is a one of my personal projects. This application allows users to sign up, create their own appointments. Each appointment has a template client and a price. Don't worry about keeping track of how much money your making at each template or with a specific client.... the app takes care of that as you'll see below.
